# GreenFlagLoginPage

<p>This was actually the first full application that I built before I<br>
switched over to Kotlin! The app just has an introduction page, and then<br>
using intents, goes to another activity where we check user validation<br>
for their email and password, then toast a message when it's complete.</p>
